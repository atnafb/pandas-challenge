The goal is to analyze student performance trends in math and reading, compare the effectiveness of charter and district schools, and inform teh mayor and the boards inform future 
budgeting and strategic decisions. The analysis is based on standardized test data, school budgets, and student performance metrics.

## The analysis includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, aggregation, and analysis of the standardized test results.
- A detailed report summarizing the key findings and recommendations for school improvement and resource allocation.

## Project Goals
- Assess school performance in terms of math and reading scores.
- Identify trends in school performance across different school types (charter vs district schools).
- Provide data-driven recommendations for targeted school improvements and budgeting.

## Data
- The dataset includes student performance data across various schools, with information on math and reading test scores, school budgets, and more.
